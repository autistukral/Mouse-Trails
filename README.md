Simple app that let's you change the mouse trail count (up to a value of 100) so that when using apps such as Parsec other people connected to you via Parsec can see your cursor.

You can also set an auto update on a customizable timer so that the app checks if the trail cout was changed and sets it back to a value defined by you.

This app has Start on startup option.
